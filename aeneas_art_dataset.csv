In Pliny the Elder’s Natural History there is a description of such a sculpture, carved on the island of Rhodes around 40 B.C. by three artists, Hagesandros, Polydoros and Athenodoros. According to Pliny, it was destined for the palace of Titus, and indeed on 14 January 1506 this sculpture was unearthed in the ruins of the so-called Baths of Titus, in the vineyard of one Felice de’ Freddi. However, this sculpture is now thought to be a Roman copy of the late Hellenistic original described by Pliny. When discovered, the group was in pieces, with parts of the serpents’ coils and the three right arms of the figures missing. It was inaccurately restored by Giovanni da Montorsoli in the 16th century and these restorations are faithfully preserved in the Crawford cast, which was made around 1816 by Canova in the Vatican Museum.

(The title words 'Quos Ego' come from Neptune's speech at Aeneid I, 135.) According to Vasari, the ‘Neptune surrounded by little pictures from the story of Aeneas’, was among the first prints made in Rome by Marcantonio, after the Judgement of Paris and Massacre of the Innocents. Whatever their order, Vasari gives an accurate ranking of the most important prints resulting from Marcantonio’s partnership with Raphael. As with the two other prints named, preparatory drawings by Raphael, the same size as the elements from the print represented, confirm his role as designer of this unsigned work. The Chatsworth drawings show—in the same sense as the print—the two small scenes that appear to the right of the central storm scene. The print dates from no later than 1516, the year given on a copy of this work (Hind, 1938-48, Vol. 5, p. 38.The work illustrates episodes from book I of Virgil’s Aeneid. Nine small images surround a larger scene of Neptune intervening to save the Trojan fleet from the storm: Aeneas and his followers are cast ashore in Carthage, where bottom right he feasts with Dido. It has been observed that the scenes are presented in the form of an ancient relief sculpture known as a tabula iliaca, but the design also resembles ancient Roman vaulted ceilings, with small pictures separated by frames, a scheme emulated by Raphael’s workshop in, for example, the Stufetta of Cardinal Bibbiena completed in 1516. Virgil’s epic about the foundation of Rome was the most popular Latin book of the period. Scenes from the Aeneid, especially the meeting of Dido and Aeneas from Book IV were painted on 15th-century marriage chests and Virgil was well known through the poetry of Dante and Petrarch who both emulated him. This work, however-the earliest separate Virgil print-is evidence of a new and serious interest in the original text. Five Latin hexameter verses describe the events portrayed. They were composed by the Roman poet Vomanus to summarise the contents of Book I. This reference is distinctly erudite and points to the influence of Raphael’s friend Pietro Bembo. The use of these verses, the ‘argumenta Aeneidos’, almost certainly indicates that Raphael had to hand the octavo text of Virgil published in Venice by Aldus Manutius in 1501. Manutius’s innovative pocket texts of classic works were inspired by portable manuscripts in Bembo’s library. Bembo is named in Castiglione’s Courtier: he was at the court of Urbino in 1506, when his portrait was painted by Raphael, and he renewed their friendship when he came to Rome as Secretary to Pope Leo X in 1513. Among Bembo’s literary treasures was a fifth-century manuscript of Virgil, the earliest in existence. Its 50 small illustrations were clearly known to Raphael and Marcantonio since it provided ancient prototypes for the image of the Penates (pictura 20) in Raphael’s Morbetto drawing (Joannides 1983 349), engraved by Marcantonio, and of Laocoön (pictura 13) which was paraphrased in the engraving by Marco Dente da Ravenna (B.XIV.195.243).""",Hunterian Museum,Hunterian Museum,United Kingdom,printed in black on antique laid paper,Fair Use,Europeana API,,"Neptune, Quos Ego, Trojans","92H1411 Neptune quieting the storm, 'quos ego' (Virgil, Aeneid I 135)",,Book I,engraving,print,,Neptune Calming the Tempest which Aeolus Raised against Aeneas' Fleet,en,,,i_1122.png,Hunterian Museum,"Smith, John",engraver,,,British,,1600,1699,1650,1600-1699,17th century,"This is a scene from Virgil's ""Aeneid"".

As the poet recites the words ""Tu Marcellus eris"" (""Marcellus you shall be""), he is abruptly halted by Augustus: Octavia has just fainted into the emperor's lap upon hearing the name of her dead son. Livia, who is believed to have commanded the murder of Marcellus, appears impassive, while Augustus' advisors, Marcus Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas, whisper suspiciously in the background. A nude statue of Marcellus presides over the nocturnal scene: illuminated by a flickering candle, it projects a ghostly shadow onto the wall at upper right. Marcellus was Augustus' nephew and adoptive son; when he died, Livia's son Tiberius became heir to the throne. The drawing is a wonderful example of Ingres' romantic-classicist interpretation of scenes from antiquity, as it fuses archaeological exactitude with carefully calibrated emotional drama. Ingres used white chalk highlights throughout to illuminate and animate the figures and to direct the viewer's gaze within the scene. The beautiful blue paper further enhances the nocturnal lighting effects and lugubrious mood. A related canvas is in the Musée des Augustins, Toulouse; it was commissioned in 1811 by General Miollis, Napoléon I's French governor in Rome.

New mothers in Renaissance Italy were often presented with maiolica birth sets. Although no complete set survives, these gifts consisted of five interlocking pieces: a footed broth bowl and its cover (which doubled as a plate), a drinking cup, a salt cellar, and a lid. When assembled, these objects formed a single unit and any imagery on the interior—in this case, a series of scenes from ancient mythology—was hidden from view. The subjects may have been chosen for their symbolic meanings: Aeneas carrying his father out of burning Troy for its theme of filial piety; Pyramis and Thisbe for the power of love; and Hercules and the Nemean Lion perhaps to foretell the strength and virtues of the child just born. The first of the inscriptions—""God with his hands created you so fair that now to mortal eyes you appear more precious than any oriental gem""—must have referred to the mother.

The story of Aeneas and Achates is taken from Book I of the Aeneid, where Aeneas and his faithful companion Achates, their journey just begun, take refuge on the Libyan coast after their ships are wrecked in a storm.Two other surviving scenes from the Aeneid by Dosso have been located, one in England, the other in Canada, and along with the Washington canvas have been identified as part of a frieze of ten pictures painted by the artist for the camerino, or study of Alfonso d'Este in his castle at Ferrara. Dosso Dossi was greatly influenced by Venetian art, especially the use of color and treatment of landscape as seen in works by Titian and Giorgione. He was perhaps best known in his time for soft, feathery landscapes and scenes of everyday life that are nevertheless infused with a touch of fantasy.",National Gallery of Art,National Gallery of Art,United States,oil on canvas,Open Access,Brenner,,"Aeneas, Achates, Carthage, Trojans","96B23 Aeneas and Achates reach Carthage, where building is in progress",,Book I,painting,painting,"Brenner, Carla McKinney, et al.

Suspecting trickery, Laocoön had warned his countrymen not to accept the wooden horse left outside Troy by the Greeks and had hurled his spear at it to prove that it was hollow. Thus the priest incurred the wrath of the gods, for desecrating an object dedicated to the goddess Athena. El Greco depicted serpents, sent by the angry gods, engaging Laocoön and one son in a mortal struggle, while a second son lies already dead at his father's side. The identity of the unfinished figures on the right continues to be debated; perhaps they represent the gods themselves supervising their vengeance.Utilizing every available means — writhing line, lurid color, and illogically conceived space — the artist projected an unrelieved sense of doom. The figures seem incorporeal; sinuous outlines and anti–natural flesh tones contribute to their specterlike appearance. The striking setting carries this visionary late work of El Greco to an apocalyptic extreme.Did El Greco intend to relate this mythical theme of conflict and divine retribution to the Inquisition then raging in Toledo? Whatever the case, the story of Laocoön is the only classical theme he is known to have painted.More information on this painting can be found in the Gallery publication Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries, which is available as a free PDF https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/research/publications/pdfs/spanish-painting-15th-19th-centuries.pdf",National Gallery of Art,National Gallery of Art,United States,oil on canvas,Open Access,Brenner,,"Laocoön, serpent",94H213 Laocoon and his twin sons are strangled by two serpents during the preparations for a sacrifice,,Book II,painting,painting,"Brenner, Carla McKinney, et al.

Such paintings were often commissioned around the time of marriage. Although they were not aimed exclusively at women, they often – like this painting – told stories of virtuous females, who sacrificed themselves for the sake of their family and their ‘patria’.Liberale’s painting is based on Book 4 of Virgil’s ‘Aeneid’, which tells of the hopeless love of the widowed Dido, Queen of Carthage for the wandering Trojan prince Aeneas – hopeless because Jupiter, king of the gods, had decreed that Aeneas’s destiny lay in Italy, with the foundation of Rome as a ‘new Troy’. Virgil’s Latin epic (left unfinished at the poet’s death in 19 BC) provided an imaginative prehistory for what was, by his day, the very long-standing enmity between the peoples of North Africa and the Roman Empire. Like Ovid’s ‘Metamorphoses’, Virgil’s great poem was well known to 15th-century Italians, and indeed it remains part of the common European cultural heritage today.The tragedy of DidoHere, Dido plunges a dagger into her chest as she stands on a funeral pyre. The pyre is topped with a hexagonal piece of furniture, perhaps the bed (albeit a strangely shaped one) in which Dido had intended to celebrate the marriage she believed she had contracted with Aeneas. But he had departed for his ship, and was preparing to cross the Mediterranean to his new promised land. Dido’s regal dignity is palpable; so is her deep distress and anger, conveyed by her positioning of Aeneas’s helm and armour – symbols of arms and of the man, to paraphrase the opening of Virgil’s poem – at her feet. Flames lap around the platform on which they are placed, ready to consume Aeneas’s possessions and the body of the queen he had abandoned.The architectural setting makes this private tragedy into a public event. Spectators, probably the members of her court, crowd the arcades and balconies of the portico and palaces around Dido’s pyre, and spill out into the street. The artist has used the architecture to divide the painting into three approximately equal sections: Dido herself; the watching bystanders; and the landscape at the far ends of the panel. In the countryside at the right, military exercises are taking place. Presumably this is a proleptic reference to Aeneas’s future military adventures in Italy. The seascape at the left-hand side of the panel probably alludes to his voyages across the Mediterranean: to Dido’s court at Carthage, and then westwards towards Latium. Cassone paintings such as this often play havoc with time, linking narrative episodes which may have happened years apart, and Liberale’s panel is no exception. A north Italian piazzaThe piazza – flanked by civic buildings, loggias and porticos – recalls those found in several north Italian cities, such as Brescia, Verona or Vicenza. Stories of antiquity were often represented by Italian 15th-century artists as if they had happened in partially recognisable surroundings, although they were never intended to translate ancient history into contemporary Italy. An apt comparison is provided by the Florentine Biagio di Antonio’s depiction of Troy, in a pair of paintings now in the Fitzwilliam Museum (figs. 1 and 2). In their amalgamation of the ancient and modern – classical circus, triumphal column, a domed church resembling Florence’s Santa Maria del Fiore, town gates, and a triumphal arch – they represent a type very common in northern Italy.Liberale da Verona prepared the architecture of his painting carefully. Lines incised into the gesso, still visible when the picture is viewed from the side in raking light, were used to properly proportion the buildings. However, the architecture was drawn freehand, and although the picture appears to be equally proportioned, neither the buildings nor the implied vanishing point in the middle of Dido’s feet are absolutely symmetrical. The architectural content of the painting was also consciously planned. It contains both Renaissance and ancient structures, shown at different points in their lives.This mixture of architectural types was particularly attuned to the architectural reality of Verona in the late 15th century. Verona was then – as it is today – the Italian city with the most surviving Roman architecture after Rome itself. The circus or amphitheatre in Liberale’s picture is complete – as of course Verona’s amphitheatre still is, in essentials, and the distant building glimpsed at the end of the right-hand street is based on Verona’s surviving Roman gate, the Porta Borsari.Other Classical structures are less complete. A ruined pier, with applied pilaster shafts, stands at the right foreground. At least three arches would have sprung from it, so it is evidently the remains of a large and impressive ‘all’antica’ building. Behind it we see a semi-circular recessed apse (partially built from brick), with a vaulted arcade receding into the middle distance, which looks unfinished rather than ruinous. This particular mixture of architectural forms conveys a sense both of historical distance, and of proximity to the contemporary world, as if ‘architectural time’ is separate from real time.This approach to architectural context was particularly appropriate to the interpretation of Dido’s death in late 15th-century Italy. Women were encouraged to emulate Dido’s devotion to her lineage, and to her husband’s memory – but not of course her suicide, a mortal sin. It is by means of architecture that Liberale makes the mixed messages of Dido’s tragic end so evident.Caroline Campbell Selected literature                                                                                                                                                                         Davies 1961, pp. 283–4; Del Bravo 1967, p. 79.",The National Gallery,The National Gallery,United Kingdom,oil on poplar,Fair Use,de Jong,,"Dido, Carthage, death","96B3 the tragedy of Dido (Virgil, Aeneid IV)",96B332 death of Dido; she climbs the funeral pyre and falls upon the sword of Aeneas,Book IV,painting,painting,"De Jong, Jan L. “Dido in Italian Renaissance Art.

This poetic landscape is his last painting. The subject is derived from Virgil’s Aeneid which describes Ascanius, the son of the Trojan hero Aeneas, hunting in the countryside of Latium with his companions. Unknowingly he is the instrument of the Fury Allecto who has been sent by the goddess Juno to provoke war. Allecto alerts the hunting dogs to the presence of the regal stag that has come to take refreshment in the cool river. The stag is the tame pet of Silvia, the daughter of Tyrrheus, ranger to the king of the Latins. Ascanius mortally wounds the stag, setting in motion a train of events that lead to war.The monstrous Fury is not shown, but the wind bending the trees on the left and the impending storm seen in the scudding clouds evoke his malign intervention. Claude depicts the last moment between peace and war, as the arc of the arrow cuts through the air. The harmoniously composed landscape, unfolding into the distant mountains, is based on Claude’s intense study of nature that he made in the Roman Campagna earlier in his career.The Landscape with Ascanius was painted for Prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, an important collector who was one of Claude’s great patrons.

The event depicted is drawn directly from the Aeneid and narrates the moment in a hunting expedition when Juno provokes a storm that obliges Dido and Aeneas to take shelter in a cave (IV, verses 160-166).Here, as in his Landscape with Leto and the Peasants Transformed into Frogs (P000897), Agüero bases his composition on models by other artists. The group of figures with the queen dismounting a horse whose powerful hindquarters face the viewer comes directly from a now-lost composition by Rubens known through Mazo´s copy (Díaz Padrón, Catalog, 1975, p. 334). As R. López Torrijos pointed out, while Agüero has considerably simplified it, and has removed the cherubs that accompanied the original, Rubens´s model is still perfectly recognizable. Moreover, Agüero´s dog is almost literally the one Velázquez painted in his portrait of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria in Hunting Garb (P001186). The horse, while less exact, noticeably echos the one in Velázquez´s Surrender of Breda (P001172).This canvas is an excellent example of Agüero´s mastery, completely immersed in a palatial atmosphere steeped in Velázquez, Venice, and Rubens´s lyricism.",Museo Nacional del Prado,Museo Nacional del Prado,Spain,oil on canvas,©Museo Nacional del Prado,Reid,,"Dido, Aeneas, sex, cave scene, Carthage, hunting",96B322 Dido and Aeneas shelter from the storm in a cave,,Book IV,painting,painting,"Reid, Jane Davidson, and Chris Rohmann.

The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears. But the human delicacy of Barrocci's anti-heroic and anti-rhetorical figures was not to be really appreciated in Rome, because it could not compete with the classical antique statuary.",Web Gallery of Art,Galleria Borghese,Italy,oil on canvas,"© Web Gallery of Art, created by Emil Krén and Daniel Marx",Reid,,"Aeneas, Anchises, Ascanius, Creusa, Penates","96B113 'Pius Aeneas': Aeneas, leading Ascanius, escapes from burning Troy, carrying his father Anchises with the Penates; his wife Creusa, who sets out with them, is lost on the way",,Book II,painting,painting,"Reid, Jane Davidson, and Chris Rohmann.

For his reception piece at the Academy in 1711, Cayot treated this dramatic Virgilian episode with virtuosity, neglecting neither the drama of the moment nor the sensuality of the abandoned queen.The iconographyDido, the founder and queen of Carthage, has just been abandoned by the Trojan hero Aeneas, son of Venus, gone in search of a new kingdom. She decides to kill herself on a pyre built to burn her faithless lover's possessions. The theme is taken from Virgil's Aeneid (written in the 1st century BC), which recounts the legendary adventures of Aeneas: his flight after the sack of Troy by the Greeks, and his journey to Italy where he was to found the Roman Empire.Death and sensualityThe scene is theatrical: the queen, kneeling on the pyre, eyes raised heavenward, plunges her lover's sword into her breast, thrusting the sheath behind her with her left arm. A few drops of blood flow from the wound.Tragedy and sensuality are closely mingled here: Dido's suicidal pose, as she kneels on a soft cushion, is both elegant and revealing. Her fine tunic, open at her breast, shows the line of her thigh; the flowing cloak that has slipped from her shoulder is held in place at the hip by a finely-worked clasp, and a lock of hair emphasizes the nudity of her shoulder.A virtuoso workCayot demonstrated his skillful rendering of textures with this funeral pyre: an artful pile of branches, logs, and Aeneas's armor. The Trojan hero's helmet with its plumed crest is an enormous fish head with an evil-looking eye, its gaping mouth turned toward the spectator.The artist presented this virtuoso work for his admission into the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture on 31 December 1711. In the 18th century, sculpture in the round replaced the bas-relief work previously required by the institution.BibliographySouchal François, French Sculptor of the 17th and 18th centuries, The reign of Louis XIV, Oxford, I, n. 6a, p. 87 ; IV, n. 6, p. 27.",Louvre,Musée du Louvre,France,marble,© Musée du Louvre,Reid,,"Dido, death","96B3 the tragedy of Dido (Virgil, Aeneid IV)",96B332 death of Dido; she climbs the funeral pyre and falls upon the sword of Aeneas,Book IV,sculpting,sculpture,"Reid, Jane Davidson, and Chris Rohmann.

The beautiful Carthaginian, vehement and desperate, suddenly seized with fury, seized the sword of Aeneas by inflicting her breast and throwing herself on the burning pyre thus giving herself death ( Eneide , I, 630, IV, 412). In the version of the same subject of little precedent and kept in Chambéry (see Spike 1999, n.19) Mattia Preti highlighted the disgrace of the pagan heroine: Dido is in fact portrayed with an expression of tragic acceptance of destiny.In the Braunschweig variant, the heroic Carthaginian queen is portrayed with full mastery of her actions, and imperturbable in giving herself torture, a stoic interpreter of her own misfortune; the woman is rendered with a determined and sure look, recalling in her attitude the Christian saints, and in particular Saint Catherine of Alexandria, often the interpreter of the highest Pretean compositions (Spike 1999). The composition is set in a rather traditional way: Dido, in the foreground, in a slightly raised position on the pyre; around the servants is the crown in a series of scenic plans. The re-enactments of Veronese's painting are evident, even in the monumental columns, which act as a scenic backdrop to the representation, wrapped in wide draperies.The history of the painting is recent, linked to private collections and auction houses, and no literary or archival source can indicate the original location. The dating is between 1665 and 1670 (Spike 1999), when, compatibly with the numerous public commitments in Malta, Mattia Preti continued to paint compositions of historical theme also and above all for non-island commissions. ASVittorio Sgarbi - Mattia Preti - Rubbettino, Soveria Mannelli (CS), 2013",Mattia Preti,Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum,Germany,oil on canvas,Fair Use,Reid,,"Dido, death","96B3 the tragedy of Dido (Virgil, Aeneid IV)",96B332 death of Dido; she climbs the funeral pyre and falls upon the sword of Aeneas,Book IV,painting,painting,"Reid, Jane Davidson, and Chris Rohmann.

The identity of the scene is confirmed by the presence in the distant sky of the meteor mentioned obliquely by Virgil in his text. Until recently-since at least 1867-the painting was thought to be a depiction of the Trojan hero, Hector, taking his leave of his wife, Andromache, and his father, Priam, and son, Astyanax, as recounted in Book VI of Homer's Iliad. The artist's companion piece to this painting is ""Chryseis Returned to Her Father Chryses,"" also in the Society's collection (accession No. 1865.1).

El motivo representado, viene directamente de la Eneida, y se refiere al momento en que, durante una cacería, Juno hace que se desate una tormenta y esto obliga a Dido y Eneas a cobijarse en una cueva (IV, versos 160-166).Agüero se ha servido para la composición, como en el caso del Paisaje con Latona y los campesinos transformados en ranas (P000897), de modelos ajenos. El grupo de la reina descabalgando, con el caballo presentando la poderosa grupa al espectador, viene directamente de una composición de Rubens, hoy perdida, que conocemos por la copia que de ella realizó Mazo (Díaz Padrón, Catálogo, 1975, p. 334). Aunque se ha simplificado considerablemente y han desaparecido los amorcillos que acompañaban la escena, es perfectamente reconocible el modelo, como señaló R. López Torrijos. También el perro es, casi literalmente, el que Velázquez pintó en el retrato del Cardenal-infante Fernando de Austria, cazador (P001186) y en el caballo -aunque con menos fidelidad-, se advierte un eco del de Las lanzas velazqueñas (P001172).El lienzo es una muestra excelente de la maestría de Agüero, inmerso por entero en la atmósfera de Palacio impregnada de Velázquez, de Venecia y de la lírica rubeniana (Texto extractado de Pérez Sánchez, A. E.: Carreño, Rizi, Herrera y la pintura madrileña de su tiempo. 1650-1700, Ministerio de Cultura, 1986, p. 277).                                                 English Translation: It is a superb example of the type of landscape that Agüero and Mazo cultivate at the service of the Court, already marked by the knowledge of the works of Claudio de Lorena and - especially in this case - of Salvatore Rosa. The reason represented, comes directly from the Aeneid , and refers to the time when, during a hunt, Juno causes a storm to break out and this forces Dido and Aeneas to shelter in a cave (IV, verses 160-166).Agüero has been used for the composition, as in the case of the Landscape with Latona and the peasants transformed into frogs ( P000897 ), of alien models. The group of the queen dismounting, with the horse presenting the powerful rump to the spectator, comes directly from a composition of Rubens, today lost, that we know from the copy made by Mazo (Díaz Padrón, Catalog , 1975, p.334) . Although it has been considerably simplified and the sweeties that accompanied the scene have disappeared, the model is perfectly recognizable, as R. López Torrijos pointed out. Also the dog is, almost literally, the one that Velázquez painted in the portrait of the Cardinal-infant Fernando de Austria, hunter ( P001186) and on the horse -although with less fidelity-, an echo of the Las lanzas velazqueñas ( P001172 ) is noticed .The canvas is an excellent example of Agüero's mastery, immersed entirely in the atmosphere of Palacio impregnated with Velázquez, Venice and the Ruben lyric (Text extracted from Pérez Sánchez, AE: Carreño, Rizi, Herrera and Madrid's painting his time, 1650-1700, Ministry of Culture, 1986, p 277).",Museo Nacional del Prado,Museo Nacional del Prado,Spain,oil on canvas,©Museo Nacional del Prado,Reid,,"Dido, dog, horse, landscape, cave scene",96B322 Dido and Aeneas shelter from the storm in a cave,,Book IV,painting,painting,"Reid, Jane Davidson, and Chris Rohmann.
